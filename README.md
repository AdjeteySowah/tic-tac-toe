# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is part of [The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript course - JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript). It is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where players can compete against each other or an AI opponent. The game dynamically updates the board and keeps track of scores.

## Features
- Play Tic-Tac-Toe in a 3x3 grid format.
- Two game modes:
  - **Player vs Player**: Two human players take turns.
  - **Player vs AI**: Play against an AI with basic to medium difficulty.
- Winning combinations highlight dynamically with animations.
- Displays the winner or a draw result at the end of each game.
- Keeps track of player scores across rounds.
- Fully responsive design, playable on desktop and mobile devices.

## Game Modes
- **Player vs Player**:
  - Each player alternates turns, placing their marker ("X" or "O") in an empty cell.
- **Player vs AI**:
  - The human player competes against an AI opponent. The AI makes decisions based on basic logic, including blocking moves and prioritizing winning moves.

## How to Play
1. Select your desired game mode (Player vs Player or Player vs AI) on the home screen.
2. In the game screen:
   - Player X always starts first.
   - Click on an empty cell to place your marker.
   - The game ends when there is a winner (3 markers in a row, column, or diagonal) or the board is full (draw).
3. A winning combination will blink before the result is displayed.
4. Play another round by clicking the "Restart" button.
